## Sentiment Analysis on Chinese Weibo regarding COVID-19

We performed sentiment analysis on Weibo posts related to COVID-19. Therefore, we constructed the COVID-19 sentiment analysis dataset that consists of the following three parts, including NLPCC sentiment analysis dataset, emotional conversation dataset and our own annotated dataset. Instead of using coarse feeling, in this work, we annotated the Weibo posts by 7 fine-grained feelings, i.e., fear, anger, disgust, sadness, gratitude, surprise, and optimism.

After carefully validation, we form the sentiment analysis data set that consists of 21,173 Weibo posts falling into 7 sentiment categories, e.g., anger, disgust, fear, optimism, sadness, surprise, and gratitude. The number of posts for each category of sentiment is shown in the following table:

|Sentiment category|Number|
|:----:|:----:|
|Fear|3227|
|Anger|3175|
|Disgust|2203|
|Sadness|2756|
|Optimism|3595|
|Gratitude|3072|
|Surprise|3145|

The correspondence between sentiment categories and labels is as follows:

|Sentiment category|Label|
|:----:|:----:|
|Fear|0|
|Disgust|1|
|Optimism|2|
|Surprise|3|
|Gratitude|4|
|Sadness|5|
|Anger|6|
